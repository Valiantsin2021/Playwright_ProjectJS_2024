      - paragraph: With the Fusion Backpack strapped on, every trek is an adventure - even a bus ride to work. That's partly because two large zippered compartments store everything you need, while a front zippered pocket and side mesh pouches are perfect for stashing those little extras, in case you change your mind and take the day off.
